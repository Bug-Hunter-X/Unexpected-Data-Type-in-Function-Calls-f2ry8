# VBScript Bug: Unexpected Data Type in Function Calls

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in VBScript related to unexpected data types passed to functions. VBScript's flexible typing can mask errors where a function receives incorrect data, leading to unpredictable behavior.  The bug example involves a function expecting a numerical input but receiving a string, leading to an error or incorrect output.

The solution emphasizes the importance of input validation and using appropriate type conversion techniques to mitigate this issue.  While VBScript's loose typing can be convenient, proper type handling is vital for robust applications.
